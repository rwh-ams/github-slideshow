<h1>Participant Information Sheet</h1>
<h2>The research project and this study</h2>
<p>This study forms part of a UK-wide research project which is investigating flood resilience in urban areas.  The data collected in this study will be used to explore implicitly held associations with regards to perceptions of rainwater harvesting.  We are further interested in whether results from implicit association tests match those obtained in self-reporting measures (surveys, questionnaires, etc.). </p>

<p>Rainwater harvesting can contribute to reducing pressure on urban drainage infrastructure with respect to flood mitigation but uptake of such systems in the UK is generally low. Understanding public perceptions of rainwater harvesting systems is critical to understanding the lack of implementation. </p>

<h2>What is involved?</h2>
<p>We will ask you to complete three short tests, each of which last 3-4 minutes. Participating in the study should take no longer than 10-12 minutes of your time. All three tests involve studying sets of images and answering a series of questions about them. In the third test, the Implicit Association Test (IAT), we record how quickly you respond to the images and a series of negative and positive words. We are interested in how quickly you make associations between the two.</p>
<p>We have identified no risks associated with participating in this study. Please note that participation is entirely voluntary, no monetary reward is being offered for taking part.
